Leveraging single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we constructed a comprehensive molecular atlas of the human aorta through integrated analysis of 361,152 cells from 60 healthy and diseased (AAA, TAA, AD) samples. Our high-resolution profiling identified 23 functionally distinct cell subpopulations, including 7 endothelial, 7 vascular smooth muscle, and 9 fibroblast subtypes, each exhibiting conserved and disease-specific transcriptional signatures. Spatial transcriptomics further revealed the precise spatial localization of these cell subpopulations within the aorta. Intercellular communication analysis revealed subtype-specific signaling pathways (VEGF, PDGF, Wnt, TGFB, ANGPTL, SPP1) underlying vascular homeostasis and pathology. Transcription factor network analysis further identified differentially regulated downstream target genes within cell subtype-specific regulatory modules. This open-access single-cell transcriptomic atlas provides essential data for understanding the heterogeneity and functional characteristics of cell types in the aortic wall, revealing dynamic changes in cellular composition and gene expression in healthy and diseased states, and offering potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future diagnostic and treatment strategies.
